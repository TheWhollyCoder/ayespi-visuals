          <h1>About Austin</h1>
          <p>Austin Parks is a photographer and short filmmaker (visual artist) located in the
            DMV (D.C., Maryland, Virginia). Currently living in PG County, Maryland, he first
            discovered photography in his senior year of high school at the age of 16. It was
            during this time that he realized how often he found himself capturing moments on
            his iPod camera, so he decided it was time to take that step to do so using an actual
            camera. Receiving his first DSLR from his parents for his 17th birthday, his love for
            photography, and eventually film, was allowed the opportunity to blossom. Prior to
            high school graduation, his main subjects remained landscapes and family. However,
             transitioning into college, he began compounding his portfolio by shooting with many
             of his surrounding peers, covering various events including music festivals and art
             shows, and taking portraits of the people he cares about. He has also gained some
             experience with developing short creative films. He is always searching for ways he
             can learn and grow as an artist and ultimately just enjoys using his camera to create
             a visual product from his perspective.
